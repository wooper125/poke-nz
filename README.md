# Choosing `pokeemerald` or **`pokeemerald-expansion`**

# About this branch
This branch adds 5 new pockets to the bag based on changes to it from later generations:
* Medicine (HP, PP and status recovery items)
* Power-Up (Evolution Items, Vitamins, Mints, Candies)
* Battle Items (X items, Pokédoll/FluffyTail and hold items with battle effects)
* Mega Stones
* Z-Crystals

The new order for the pockets is the following:
* Items
* Medicine
* Poké Balls
* Battle Items
* Berries
* Power-Up
* Mega Stones
* Z-Crystals
* TMs & HMs
* Key Items

However, it reuses the original pocket sprites.
