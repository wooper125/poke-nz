**`pokeemerald-expansion`** is a GBA ROM hack base that equips developers with a comprehensive toolkit for creating Pok√©mon ROM hacks. **`pokeemerald-expansion`** is built on top of [pret's `pokeemerald`](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald) decompilation project. **It is not a playable Pok√©mon game on its own.** 

# [Features](FEATURES.md)

**`pokeemerald-expansion`** offers hundreds of features from various [core series Pok√©mon games](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Core_series), along with popular quality-of-life enhancements designed to streamline development and improve the player experience.

# About this branch
This branch adds 5 new pockets to the bag based on changes to it from later generations:
* Medicine (HP, PP and status recovery items)
* Power-Up (Evolution Items, Vitamins, Mints, Candies)
* Battle Items (X items, Pok√©doll/FluffyTail and hold items with battle effects)
* Mega Stones
* Z-Crystals

The new order for the pockets is the following:
* Items
* Medicine
* Pok√© Balls
* Battle Items
* Berries
* Power-Up
* Mega Stones
* Z-Crystals
* TMs & HMs
* Key Items

However, it reuses the original pocket sprites.
